# Snake-Water-Gun Game

## Overview:
This is a simple Python game based on the classic Snake-Water-Gun game. It includes a persistent high score system, so your high score is saved even after closing the game—just like in the games I’ve played growing up.

## Features:

Play the Snake-Water-Gun game against the computer.

Persistent high score system using a text file (Hi_score.txt).

Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## How to Run:

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Download or clone this repository.

Open the complete folder in VS Code.

Run the main game file:

python main_code_file.py

### Winning Conditions:

Snake v/s Water : Snake will win

Water v/s Gun : Gun will win

Gun v/s Snake : Gun will win

Play and enjoy! Your high score will be saved automatically.

## Files:

main_code_file.py → Core game logic.

Hi_score.txt → Stores the persistent high score.

README.md → Project overview and instructions.

## Future Improvements / Notes:

Add graphics or GUI to make the game more interactive.

Add sound effects for a richer experience.

Expand to more advanced game mechanics if desired.

## Key Learning:
While developing this project, I faced a challenge with storing and displaying the high score. Initially, I could not find a solution that fit my program structure. After experimentation and problem-solving, I implemented a custom solution using file handling, which taught me an important lesson:

While we can learn from others, we must develop our own solutions to problems to ensure they fit our specific context.

This project strengthened my problem-solving skills, persistence, and understanding of Python file operations.

## Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Basic file handling (read/write operations)
