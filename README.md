# Snake-Water-Gun Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Snake-Water-Gun** game built in **Python**. The game allows a single player to play against the computer, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws. A key feature of this project is a **persistent high score system**, which stores the playerâ€™s highest score in a separate file until the player chooses to reset it.

## Features
- Single-player gameplay against the computer.
- Print everytime if you win, lose, or it was a draw.
- Stores **high scores persistently** in a separate file.
- High score is maintained across sessions until manually reset.
- Implemented entirely in Python with simple **file handling**.

---

## How to Play
1. Run the Python file:  
```bash
python snake_water_gun.py
Enter your choice: Snake, Water, or Gun.

The computer will make its move randomly.

The winner of each round is displayed, and scores are updated.

High scores are saved in a file (high_score.txt) until you reset them.

Key Learning
While developing this project, I faced a challenge with storing and displaying the high score. Initially, I could not find a solution that fit my program structure. After experimentation and problem-solving, I implemented a custom solution using file handling, which taught me an important lesson:

While we can learn from others, we must develop our own solutions to problems to ensure they fit our specific context.

This project strengthened my problem-solving skills, persistence, and understanding of Python file operations.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Basic file handling (read/write operations)
