# Snake-Water-Gun Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Snake-Water-Gun** game built in **Python**. The game allows a single player to play against the computer, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws. A key feature of this project is a **persistent high score system**, which stores the playerâ€™s highest score in a separate file until the player chooses to reset it.

## Features
- Single-player gameplay against the computer.
- Print everytime if you win, lose, or it was a draw.
- Stores **high scores persistently** in a separate file.
- High score is maintained across sessions until manually reset.
- Implemented entirely in Python with simple **file handling**.
- Print the necessary instructions player require to know at each step.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python file:  
main_code_file.py
You will be provided with the necessary instructions you need to know.

Enter your choice: Snake, Water, or Gun.

The computer will make its move randomly.

The winner of each round is displayed, and scores are updated.

Computer will ask if you want to play again.

High scores are saved in a file (high_score.txt) until you reset them.

Key Learning
While developing this project, I faced a challenge with storing and displaying the high score. Initially, I could not find a solution that fit my program structure. After experimentation and problem-solving, I implemented a custom solution using file handling, which taught me an important lesson:

While we can learn from others, we must develop our own solutions to problems to ensure they fit our specific context.

This project strengthened my problem-solving skills, persistence, and understanding of Python file operations.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Basic file handling (read/write operations)
